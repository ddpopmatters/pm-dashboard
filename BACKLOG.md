# Content Hub — Backlog

**Last updated:** 2026-03-01
**Source:** Consolidated from docs/plans/ (5 design documents, Jan 2026) + persistent todo list

## TOP PRIORITY: Simplification

**Simplification is the #1 priority** — the tool is too complex for daily use and that's the main barrier to adoption. Strip back before adding features.

From docs/plans/2026-01-12-simplification-plan.md:

- [ ] Audit all features — identify what's used vs unused
- [ ] Streamline navigation and reduce complexity
- [ ] Remove or consolidate underused features
- [ ] Simplify content creation workflow
