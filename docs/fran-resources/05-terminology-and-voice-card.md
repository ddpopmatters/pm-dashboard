## Never Use → Use Instead

| Never use                | Use instead                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overpopulation           | Unsustainable population growth / rapid population growth            |
| Population control       | Voluntary family planning access / reproductive rights               |
| Overpopulated countries  | Countries where rapid population growth compounds existing pressures |
| Too many people          | Frame around rights, access, empowerment                             |
| Population stabilisation | Rights-based approaches that support sustainable outcomes            |

**Core principle:** The problem is never people — it is lack of access to rights, education, and healthcare. Women and girls are empowered protagonists, not variables in a population equation.

## Voice Principles

**Bold & confident** — We speak with authority. Not apologetic about our position.

**Evidence-based** — Every claim backed by data. We cite sources.

**Rights-forward** — Reproductive rights are central. Women are protagonists, not variables.

**Warm & human** — Human stories. Policy connected to people. No clinical language.

**Inclusive & respectful** — Never blame populations. Frame around systemic access.

## Platform Register

Same voice — different delivery.

| Platform      | Register                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instagram** | Visual-first, conversational, emoji-light. Reels captions punchy and front-loaded. Carousel text scannable. |
| **LinkedIn**  | Professional but not corporate. Thought leadership. Longer narrative OK. Data-rich.                         |
| **Facebook**  | Warm, community-oriented. Slightly more formal than Instagram. Encourage discussion.                        |
| **BlueSky**   | Concise, witty, topical. Thread-friendly. Link to longer content where possible.                            |
| **YouTube**   | Conversational, accessible. Scripts for speaking aloud. Hook in first 5 seconds.                            |

## The Formula

**Lead with cause, not effect.**

Not: "Population growth is driving climate change"
But: "When women have genuine reproductive freedom, communities and ecosystems thrive"

**Fierce toward systems. Warm toward people.**

Not: "People in X country need to have fewer children"
But: "The systems that deny women access to healthcare and education are the problem — not the women navigating them"
