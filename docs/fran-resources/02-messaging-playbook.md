## The One-Line Brief

We build the power of people to dismantle the taboo around population growth and its impact on people and planet. Social media is where that starts.

---

## Core Narrative (memorise this)

We lead with **cause** (autonomy, rights), not **effect** (population numbers).

When women have genuine reproductive freedom — real access to contraception, education, healthcare, and economic security — they exercise it on their own terms. Sustainable population outcomes follow naturally. That is the only outcome we are working toward.

We operate at the intersection of **reproductive rights**, **environmental sustainability**, and **social justice**. They are inseparable, and we make that case with clarity and without apology.

## Voice in Five Words

| Principle                  | What it means in practice                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bold & confident**       | We speak with authority. We are not apologetic about our position.                                                  |
| **Evidence-based**         | Every claim is backed by data. We cite sources and use statistics to build credibility.                             |
| **Rights-forward**         | Reproductive rights and bodily autonomy are central to everything. Women are empowered protagonists, not variables. |
| **Warm & human**           | We tell human stories. We connect policy to people. No clinical or academic language.                               |
| **Inclusive & respectful** | We never blame specific populations. We frame around systemic access, not individual behaviour.                     |

**The register shifts by platform** — same voice, different delivery:

- **Instagram**: Visual-first, conversational, emoji-light. Reels captions punchy and front-loaded.
- **LinkedIn**: Professional but not corporate. Thought leadership. Data-rich. Longer narrative OK.
- **Facebook**: Warm, community-oriented. Slightly more formal than Instagram. Encourage discussion.
- **BlueSky**: Concise, sharp, topical. Thread-friendly. Quotable.
- **YouTube**: Conversational, accessible. Scripts for speaking aloud. Hook in first 5 seconds.

## The Four Content Pillars

Every post must serve at least one pillar. If it doesn't, don't publish it.

### Pillar 1: Reproductive Rights & Bodily Autonomy

Our lead narrative. Barriers to contraception, girls' education, the right to choose. We celebrate reproductive autonomy as an end in itself — not a means to a demographic outcome.

**Example angles:**

- Access to contraception: where it's working, where it's blocked, and why
- Girls' education as the single most powerful intervention
- Pronatalist pressure: governments and billionaires demanding more births
- Partner stories from E2P programme (Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, India)

### Pillar 2: Population & Demographics

Translating demographic data into accessible, shareable content. This is also where we challenge the Baby Bust panic.

**Example angles:**

- Population projections: what the numbers actually show (vs media spin)
- Debunking pronatalist "birth rate crisis" narratives with data
- Research findings from PM's academic partnerships
- Wellbeing economics vs growth-at-all-costs

### Pillar 3: Environmental Sustainability

Connecting population dynamics to environmental breakdown — biodiversity, water, land, climate. Plus the "Happy Planet" framing: showing the destination, not just the problem.

**Example angles:**

- Resource pressure: water, land, biodiversity loss linked to consumption at scale
- Success stories where rights-based approaches led to thriving communities
- Connecting population to climate in ways the sustainability movement has avoided
- Never blame individuals for consumption driven by inequality

### Pillar 4: Social Justice

The structural conditions that make genuine choice impossible. Economics, gender discrimination, healthcare, education.

**Example angles:**

- The economics of reproductive rights: what happens when communities can invest
- Debt crisis preventing health/education infrastructure
- Gender equality as foundation, not add-on
- Global inequality: the divide is power, not geography

## Counter-Narratives Cheat Sheet

These are the narratives we actively challenge. Know them, spot them, respond.

| Hostile narrative                                  | PM's response                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Birth rates are collapsing — we need more babies" | Falling birth rates reflect women exercising genuine choice. The "crisis" framing serves economies built on endless growth, not the women being pressured to have children they don't want.      |
| "Overpopulation is the real climate problem"       | Population growth compounds environmental pressures, but the framing matters. We talk about unsustainable growth driven by lack of access to rights — never about there being "too many people". |
| "Population control is the solution"               | We reject coercion absolutely. Voluntary family planning access is a human right. When women have genuine choice, sustainable outcomes follow.                                                   |
| "It's a problem in developing countries"           | This is not a geographic issue. Restricted reproductive rights and inequality exist everywhere. The divide is between those with power and those without.                                        |
| "Population concern = eco-fascism"                 | We ground every position in rights. Eco-fascism strips agency; we champion it. Our approach starts and ends with the autonomy of women and girls.                                                |

| **The Catalysts**        | Gen Z/Millennial intersectional activists                       | Shareable evidence connecting rights to climate. Content they're proud to repost.                                 |
| **The Silently Aware**   | Privately agree but stay silent                                 | Permission and language to have the conversation publicly.                                                        |
| **The Persuadables**     | Care about climate/equality but haven't connected to population | The bridge — show how the issues they care about link to population dynamics.                                     |
| **The Guardians**        | Long-term supporters, 55+                                       | Reassurance that our evolution honours their commitment. Warm, clear updates.                                     |
| **The Anxious Citizens** | Feeling pressure on services/housing                            | Structural explanations that redirect from anti-immigration toward systemic solutions. Highest risk of co-option. |
| **The Deciders**         | Politicians, civil servants                                     | Evidence and political cover. Show public support exists.                                                         |
| **The Shapers**          | Journalists, researchers, commentators                          | Quotable data, credible framing, story leads.                                                                     |
| **The Changemakers**     | E2P partners on the ground                                      | Amplification of their expertise. Co-creators, not subjects.                                                      |

## Five Questions Before You Post

1. **Golden Thread** — Would this survive if screenshotted and shared by a hostile account?
2. **Hook** — Does the first line / first slide / first 3 seconds stop the scroll?
3. **Platform fit** — Is this made for this platform, or just cross-posted?
4. **Share-worthy** — Would someone save this or send it to a friend?
5. **PM Voice** — Does this sound like us — evidence-led, rights-framed, human?
