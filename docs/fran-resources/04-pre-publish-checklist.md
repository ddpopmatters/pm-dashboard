# Pre-Publish Checklist

Print this or keep it open. Run through it before every post goes live.

---

## Must-Pass (content does not publish if this fails)

- [ ] **Golden Thread passed** — Would this survive a hostile screenshot?
  - [ ] No coercion (not telling anyone to have more or fewer children)
  - [ ] No blame (problem is systems, not people or places)
  - [ ] No instrumentalisation (rights are the end, not the means)
  - [ ] No co-option risk (hostile accounts can't use this to support their position)

---

## Quality Checks

- [ ] **Hook** — Does the first line / first slide / first 3 seconds stop the scroll?
- [ ] **Platform fit** — Built for this platform specifically, not just cross-posted?
- [ ] **Terminology checked** — No banned terms used:
  - "overpopulation" → use "unsustainable population growth" or "rapid population growth"
  - "population control" → use "voluntary family planning access" or "reproductive rights"
  - "overpopulated countries" → use "countries where rapid population growth compounds existing pressures"
  - "too many people" → frame around rights, access, empowerment
  - "population stabilisation" → use "rights-based approaches that support sustainable outcomes"
- [ ] **PM Voice** — Evidence-led, rights-framed, warm and human?
- [ ] **Content pillar** — Clearly serves at least one pillar (Rights / Demographics / Environment / Justice)?
- [ ] **Share-worthy** — Would someone save this or send it to a friend?

## Technical Checks

- [ ] **Alt text written** — Descriptive alt text on every image
- [ ] **Links checked** — All URLs work and go to the right place
- [ ] **Platform format correct** — Right dimensions, character count, format type
- [ ] **Copy proofed** — No typos, no broken sentences, reads well aloud
- [ ] **Hashtags** — 3-5 niche hashtags (platform-appropriate placement)
