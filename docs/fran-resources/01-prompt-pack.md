## Instagram Carousel (5 slides)

```
Write an Instagram carousel for Population Matters (5 slides).

Topic: [topic]
Content pillar: [Reproductive Rights / Population & Demographics / Environmental Sustainability / Social Justice]
Target audience: [e.g. The Catalysts — young intersectional feminists and climate justice activists]

Rules:
- Slide 1: bold claim or question that stops the scroll. No logos, no "did you know".
- Each slide must justify a swipe — new information, not repetition.
- Final slide: clear CTA (share, save, visit link in bio, tag someone).
- Text must be readable without zooming — write for a phone screen.
- Tone: evidence-led, rights-framed, warm and human. Bold but not aggressive.
- Never use: "overpopulation", "population control", "too many people", "overpopulated countries".
- Use instead: "unsustainable population growth", "voluntary family planning access", "reproductive rights".
- Lead with cause (autonomy, rights) not effect (population numbers).
- The problem is never people — it is lack of access to rights, education, and healthcare.
- Include 3-5 niche hashtags at the end of the caption.
- Write alt text for each slide.

Give me the slide text, a caption, hashtags, and alt text.

## Instagram Reel Script (30-60 seconds)

```
Write a script for a 30-60 second Instagram Reel for Population Matters.

Topic: [topic]
Hook style: [question / bold statement / myth-bust / "what if" / surprising stat]

Rules:
- Hook in the first 1.5 seconds — this determines whether anyone watches.
- Structure: Hook → Context → Evidence → Reframe → CTA.
- Write for speaking aloud, not reading. Short sentences. Conversational.
- Tone: confident, warm, evidence-led. Not preachy or academic.
- Never use: "overpopulation", "population control", "too many people".
- End with a CTA: "Save this", "Share with someone who needs to hear this", or a question.
- Include a caption (front-loaded hook, truncates after 2 lines in feed).
- Include 3-5 hashtags.

Give me: script with timings, on-screen text suggestions, caption, and hashtags.
```

## LinkedIn Thought-Leadership Post

```
Write a LinkedIn post for Population Matters.

Topic: [topic]
Angle: [data insight / counter-narrative / policy reaction / research finding / personal reflection from PM's work]
Target audience: [e.g. The Deciders — policymakers and civil servants / The Shapers — journalists and researchers]

Rules:
- Open with a bold insight, data point, or counterintuitive claim. Never "I'm excited to share".
- Write in short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each) — people skim on mobile.
- Dwell time is the highest-weighted signal — write content worth reading slowly.
- End with a question that invites substantive expertise, not just agreement.
- Tone: professional but not corporate. Authoritative. Data-rich.
- Never use: "overpopulation", "population control", "too many people".
- Lead with cause (rights, autonomy) not effect (population numbers).
- No hashtags in body. Add 3-5 relevant hashtags at the very end.
- Do not include external links in the post body (they get deprioritised). Note: "Link in comments".
- Keep under 3,000 characters.

Give me: the full post text and suggested hashtags.
```

## Facebook Community Post

```
Write a Facebook post for Population Matters.

Topic: [topic]
Content pillar: [Reproductive Rights / Population & Demographics / Environmental Sustainability / Social Justice]
Target audience: [e.g. The Guardians — long-term supporters, 55+ / The Anxious Citizens — people feeling pressure on services and housing]

Rules:
- Warm, community-oriented, slightly more formal than Instagram.
- Encourage discussion — end with a question or invitation to share experience.
- Keep copy short and conversational. Mention the benefit before the ask.
- Tone: patient, human, evidence-led. Never condescending.
- Never use: "overpopulation", "population control", "too many people", "overpopulated countries".
- Avoid external links in the main post (deprioritised by algorithm). Use "link in comments" if needed.
- The problem is never people — it is systems that deny access to rights and choices.
- A single share outweighs 50 likes — design for "I want to share this".

Give me: the post text and a suggested image description.
```

## BlueSky Thread (3-5 posts)

```
Write a BlueSky thread for Population Matters (3-5 posts, max 300 characters each).

Topic: [topic]
Angle: [reactive to news / counter-narrative / data thread / policy moment]

Rules:
- Concise, sharp, topical. Thread-friendly.
- First post is the hook — strongest statement up front.
- Number posts for clarity (1/4, 2/4, etc.).
- No link throttling on BlueSky — include links to reports/articles freely.
- Tone: conversational, quotable, witty where appropriate. Not flippant.
- Never use: "overpopulation", "population control", "too many people".

## YouTube Video Description

```
Write a YouTube video description for Population Matters.

Video title: [title]

- Include links to: the report/source cited, PM website, relevant playlist.

Give me: the full description with timestamps placeholder and links section.
```

Write a social media response for Population Matters to counter a specific narrative.

The narrative to counter: [e.g. "Birth rates are collapsing — we need more babies to save the economy"]
Platform: [Instagram / LinkedIn / BlueSky / Facebook]

Rules:
- Acknowledge the concern without dismissing the person raising it.
- Reframe with evidence: what does the data actually show?
- Redirect to rights: what does a rights-based approach look like here?
- Tone: firm, precise, human. Fierce toward systems and ideologies, never toward people.
- Never use: "overpopulation", "population control", "too many people".
- Pass the Golden Thread: could this be screenshotted and shared by a hostile account as supporting their position? If yes, rewrite.
- Show the destination: what does a world look like where this is handled well?

Give me: the post text, a suggested visual concept, and 2-3 talking points for comments.

## Full Strategy Editorial Review

Use this when you have a draft and want it reviewed against the complete PM social media strategy. This is the big one — it covers everything.

```
You are a senior editorial reviewer for Population Matters (PM), a UK-based charity working at the intersection of reproductive rights, environmental sustainability, and social justice. Review the following content against our full social media strategy.

Platform: [Instagram / LinkedIn / Facebook / BlueSky / YouTube]
Content pillar: [Reproductive Rights / Population & Demographics / Environmental Sustainability / Social Justice / unsure]
Target audience: [e.g. The Catalysts / The Guardians / general / unsure]
Content format: [Reel script / carousel / static post / text post / thread / video script / description]

My draft:
---
[paste full draft here]
---

Review against ALL of the following levels. Score each 1-5 and explain your reasoning.

### Level 1: Mission Alignment (must pass — content does not publish if this fails)
Run the Golden Thread risk assessment:
- **Coercion check:** Does this suggest women should have more or fewer children, or does it affirm their right to decide freely?
- **Blame check:** Does this locate the problem in a particular country, region, ethnic group, or class — or in systemic failures?
- **Instrumentalisation check:** Does this treat reproductive rights as a means to an environmental/demographic end, or as a fundamental right?
- **Co-option check:** Could a nationalist, eugenicist, or eco-fascist account screenshot this as supporting their position?

If ANY of these fail, stop here and provide a rewrite before continuing.

### Level 2: Voice & Terminology
- Does this sound like PM? Bold & confident, evidence-based, rights-forward, warm & human, inclusive & respectful.
- Does it lead with cause (autonomy, rights) not effect (population numbers)?
- Flag any banned terminology:
  - "overpopulation" → "unsustainable population growth" / "rapid population growth"
  - "population control" → "voluntary family planning access" / "reproductive rights"
  - "overpopulated countries" → "countries where rapid population growth compounds existing pressures"
  - "too many people" → frame around rights, access, empowerment
  - "population stabilisation" → "rights-based approaches that support sustainable outcomes"
- Is the tone fierce toward systems and ideologies, warm toward people?
- Are claims backed by evidence? Are sources cited or citable?

### Level 3: Platform Optimisation
Apply platform-specific rules:

**Instagram:** Hook in first 2 lines (truncates in feed). Carousel text readable at 24pt. 3-5 niche hashtags in caption. Saves/shares > likes. Format fits the mix (50-60% Reels, 25-30% carousels, 15-20% static).

**LinkedIn:** Opens with bold insight/data/claim (not "I'm excited to share"). Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences). Ends with question inviting expertise. No external links in body. Hashtags at end only. Under 3,000 chars. Dwell time optimised.

**Facebook:** Warm, community tone. Encourages discussion. Short, conversational copy. Benefit before ask. No external links in main post if possible. Shares > likes.

**BlueSky:** Under 300 chars per post. Strongest statement first. Threads numbered. Links OK (no throttling). Conversational, quotable.

**YouTube:** First 2 lines of description above fold. Keywords natural in title/description. Timestamps if >3 mins. Captions/subtitles. Clear CTA at end.

### Level 4: Engagement Quality
- Is this designed for saves, shares, and sends — not just likes?
- Would someone tag a friend or forward this?
- Does it give the audience something they can use in their own conversations?

### Level 5: Audience & Pillar Fit
- Does this clearly serve the stated content pillar?
- Does the framing, register, and depth match the target audience?
- If audience is The Anxious Citizens or The Guardians: is there extra care around co-option risk and tone?

### Output format:

**Scorecard:**
| Level | Score (1-5) | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Mission Alignment | | |
| Voice & Terminology | | |
| Platform Optimisation | | |
| Engagement Quality | | |
| Audience & Pillar Fit | | |

**Flags:** [list any Golden Thread, terminology, or co-option issues]

**Suggested rewrites:** [specific line-by-line improvements with reasoning]

**Improved version:** [full rewritten draft incorporating all feedback]

**What's already working:** [what to keep — be specific]

## Batch Content Review (multiple posts)

Use this when you have several posts to review at once — e.g. a week's content or a campaign batch.

```
You are a senior editorial reviewer for Population Matters. Review the following batch of social media content against our strategy.

For each post, apply the PM editorial framework:
1. Golden Thread (coercion, blame, instrumentalisation, co-option) — MUST PASS
2. Voice & terminology (banned terms, tone, evidence, cause-before-effect)
3. Platform fit (format, length, hooks, hashtags, platform-specific rules)
4. Engagement quality (save/share-worthy, useful to audience)
5. Pillar and audience alignment

Banned terminology — flag and replace:
- "overpopulation" → "unsustainable population growth"
- "population control" → "voluntary family planning access" / "reproductive rights"
- "overpopulated countries" → "countries where rapid population growth compounds existing pressures"
- "too many people" → frame around rights, access, empowerment
- "population stabilisation" → "rights-based approaches that support sustainable outcomes"

Voice: bold & confident, evidence-based, rights-forward, warm & human, inclusive & respectful. Lead with cause (autonomy) not effect (population). Fierce toward systems, warm toward people.
