# Golden Thread Cheat Sheet

The Golden Thread is PM's content risk assessment. It's the single most important check before anything goes live.

## The Screenshot Test

> **Would this survive if screenshotted and shared by a hostile account as supporting their position?**

If there's any doubt, it doesn't go out.

## Four Checks

Run every piece of content through these. All four must pass.

### 1. Coercion Check

**Ask:** Does this suggest women should have more or fewer children — or does it affirm their right to decide freely?

| Fails                                                        | Passes                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "If women had fewer children, we could solve climate change" | "When women have genuine access to family planning, they make choices that work for them — and communities thrive"   |
| "Countries need to reduce their birth rates"                 | "Every woman deserves the right to decide if and when to have children, free from pressure"                          |
| "We need to convince people to have smaller families"        | "Removing barriers to reproductive healthcare gives women real choice — and that choice drives sustainable outcomes" |

### 2. Blame Check

**Ask:** Does this locate the problem in a particular country, region, ethnic group, or economic class — or does it address systemic failures?

| Fails                                                              | Passes                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Africa's population growth is the biggest threat to biodiversity" | "Where communities lack access to healthcare and education, population growth compounds environmental pressures" |
| "Poor countries are having too many children"                      | "The gap between those with reproductive freedom and those without is a failure of systems, not of people"       |
| "Immigration is driven by overpopulation in the Global South"      | "When structural inequality denies people basic rights and security, movement is the rational response"          |

### 3. Instrumentalisation Check

**Ask:** Does this treat reproductive rights as a means to an environmental or demographic end — or as a fundamental human right?

| Fails                                                             | Passes                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Family planning is the most cost-effective climate intervention" | "Family planning is a human right. That it also supports environmental sustainability makes the case for investment even stronger"   |
| "Educating girls reduces population growth by X%"                 | "Girls' education transforms lives, expands choices, and strengthens communities. It is an end in itself"                            |
| "We need contraception to save the planet"                        | "Every woman's right to control her own body is non-negotiable. The environmental benefits are a consequence, not the justification" |

### 4. Co-option Check

**Ask:** Could a nationalist, eugenicist, or eco-fascist account share this as supporting their position?

| Fails                                                         | Passes                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The world can't support this many people"                    | "Sustainable outcomes require sustainable systems — starting with universal access to the rights people are currently denied" |
| "Population growth in [country] is unsustainable"             | "Where governments invest in healthcare, education, and reproductive rights, communities build their own sustainable futures" |
| Any content that could read as "those people are the problem" | Content that consistently frames the problem as systems, access, and power — never as people                                  |

## Edge Cases — Decision Tree

```
Is this about a specific country or region?
├── Yes → Does it name systemic failures (healthcare, education, policy)
│         rather than the people?
│   ├── Yes → Proceed, but double-check co-option risk
│   └── No → Rewrite: frame around systems, not populations
│
└── No → Continue

Does this mention birth rates, fertility, or family size?
├── Yes → Is the framing about women's autonomous choices?
│   ├── Yes → Proceed
│   └── No → Rewrite: centre rights and agency
│
└── No → Continue

Does this use statistics about population growth?
├── Yes → Is the source cited? Is the framing rights-based?
│   ├── Yes → Proceed
│   └── No → Add source + reframe around access and rights
│
└── No → Continue

Could a hostile account screenshot this without context?
├── Yes, and it would look bad → Rewrite or don't publish
└── No → Publish
```

## Quick Reference: When In Doubt

- The problem is never **people**. It is **lack of access** to rights, education, and healthcare.
- Women and girls are **empowered protagonists**, not variables in a population equation.
- Lead with **cause** (autonomy), not **effect** (population).
- **Fierce toward systems and ideologies. Warm toward people.**
- If you need to ask "does this pass?" — it probably doesn't. Rewrite.
